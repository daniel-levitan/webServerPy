What is it?
    This is a minimal webServer written in Python to test what I learned from Computer Networking from Kurose and Ross. 
    It was not based on their skeleton, I thought of it myself. 
    
    I also divided the functions minimally, just enough to have clarity on the parts.
    
    It handles one connection at a time and implements the GET and HEAD methods only.
    

Next Future Steps:
    1. Make it multithread
    2. Exit gracefully
    3. Implement advanced features of the GET methods
    4. Implement the POST method
