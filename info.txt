What is it?
    This is a minimal webServer written in Python to test what I learned from Computer Networking from Kurose and Ross. 
    It was not based on their skeleton, I thought of it myself. 
    
    I also divided the functions minimally, just enough to have clarity on the parts.
    
    It handles one connection at a time and implements the GET and HEAD methods only.
    

Next Future Steps:
    1. Make it multithread
    2. Exit gracefully
    3. Implement advanced features of the GET methods
    4. Implement the POST method
    
How to test it?
    1. If you want to test in the same machine, you need to run: > python3 webServer.py 
    2. Then you can either:
        2.1 Test with curl for an existing file: curl localhost:12000/main.html
        2.2 Test with curl for a non existing method: curl -X FAKE localhost:12000/ or curl -X PUT localhost:12000/
        2.3 You can open in your browser: http://localhost:12000/main.html 
    3. If you have access to two computers, you can look for your primary physical network interface. On a Mac I did:
        3.1 ifconfig
        3.2 Looked for en0 (primary physical network interface)
        3.3 Used the IP, ipv4 format.
